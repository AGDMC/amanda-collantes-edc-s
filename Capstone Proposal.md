### Tech Stack

Frontend: React, HTML, SASS, JavaScript, Canva, Google Fonts, Axios, Dotenv, NPM, React
Backend: Node.js, knex, cors, express, nodemon
Database: MySQL

### Implementation

#### Backend

EduConnect Backend serves as the server-side component, providing RESTful APIs for managing educational resources, events, and user data. It interacts with a MySQL database to store and retrieve information related to webinars, user profiles, and other platform entities.

#### Implementation Details

- **Project Setup and Environment Configuration:** Set up the development environment with Node.js and npm, initialize a new Node.js project, and install necessary dependencies. Configure project structure and folders. Choose and set up MySQL as the database system, create database schemas/models for initial entities, and establish a database connection in the backend application.

- **Operations for Core Entities:** Set up RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on core entities such as webinars and user profiles. Define endpoints for retrieving lists of webinars, creating new entries, updating existing entries, and deleting entries.

## Roadmap

- **Project Setup and Environment Configuration:** Set up the development environment (Node.js, npm), initialize a new Node.js project, install necessary dependencies (Express.js, etc.), configure project structure and folders, and set up the database system (SQL, etc.).
- **Operations for Core Entities:** Set up RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on core entities (e.g., Webinars).
